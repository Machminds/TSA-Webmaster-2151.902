        <h1>About Downingtown Link</h1>
        <p>
            Downingtown Link is a student created community resource hub for residents of the
            Downingtown Area School District. It brings local services, non profits, and programs
            into one simple place.
        </p>

    <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Purpose of this Website</h2>
        <p>
            Many families know that help exists somewhere, but it is hard to figure out where to
            start. Food assistance might be on one website, mental health services on another, and
            youth programs on a third. Downingtown Link tries to remove that confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site gives residents a single hub where they can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search and filter a directory of community resources</li>
            <li>Find support by type, such as food, housing, health care, or mental health</li>
            <li>See which resources are near them using mailing address cities like
                Downingtown, Exton, Chester Springs, Glenmoore, and Romansville</li>
            <li>Suggest new organizations through the Submit a Resource form</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The goal is simple: make it easier for people to ask for help, easier for them to give
            help, and easier to see what already exists in the community.
        </p>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="page-section">
        <h2>How Downingtown Link Works</h2>

        <h3>Interactive Resource Hub</h3>
        <p>
            The Resource Hub page lists community organizations with short descriptions, contact
            links, and locations. Visitors can use search and drop down filters to narrow results
            by type and city.
        </p>

        <h3>Featured Resources</h3>
        <p>
            The home page highlights a few key organizations so that users who are in a hurry can
            reach important services such as food banks or senior programs quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>Submit a Resource</h3>
        <p>
            Because communities change over time, the directory is not locked. Anyone can submit a
            new resource using the form. Submissions are reviewed before they are added to the
            public list.
        </p>

                    Kartik led the overall website structure, coding, and content organization. He

                <p>
                    Atharv contributed to branding ideas, page layout, and testing. He helped review
                    pages for clarity and made sure the site is easy for community members to
                    navigate and understand.

            This website was created for the 2025–2026 TSA Webmaster competition. It is a student
            project and is not an official website of the Downingtown Area School District, but it
            is inspired by the real needs of families who live in the district and nearby
            communities.
